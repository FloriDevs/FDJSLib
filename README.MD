Wellcome to
# FloriDevs JS Library

How to use ?
- Add FDSJSLib (without a download) to your HTML Site (recommended):
        
        <script src="https://floridevs.github.io/FDJSLib/FDJSLib.js"></script>





- Add FDSJSLib as a local library (harder to keep up to date)
1. Use wget to get the JS file

    wget https://floridevs.github.io/FDJSLib/FDJSLib.js
2. Add FDSJSLib (local) to your HTML

        <script src="FDJSLib.js"></script>
